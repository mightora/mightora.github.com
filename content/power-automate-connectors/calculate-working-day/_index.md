The Calculate Working Day API is a tool for developers to easily compute a valid working day, accommodating a range of requirements from basic to complex scenarios. It seamlessly integrates with user-defined working days and UK bank holidays and can perform a number of functions. With a more advanced setup, developers can tailor the computation to adhere to specific working day patterns. By supplying a customized list of working days—designated by their corresponding day-of-week codes—the API can precisely determine the subsequent working day, considering the user-defined schedule.
